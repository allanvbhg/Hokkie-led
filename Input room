// Version 1 //

// This is one of the first codes I made for this project. It basically just turns on the lights on the playground and nothing else //

forever(function () {
    if (pins.A1.analogRead() < 1010) {
        light.setBrightness(12)
        light.setAll(0x00ff00)
    } else {
        light.setBrightness(12)
        light.setAll(0xff0000)
    }
})

// Now I have to find a way to turn on the external led's so people actually know when the dressing room is occupied and that the staff //
// knows it is in use. //

// Version 3 //

// This makes it so that the sensor detects presure and turns it into a signal that poweres the rest. //

forever(function () {
    if (pins.A1.analogRead() < 1016) {
        pins.A2.analogWrite(0)
        light.setBrightness(12)
        light.setAll(0x00ff00)
    } else {
        pins.A2.analogWrite(50)
        light.setBrightness(12)
        light.setAll(0xff0000)
    }
})

// When the pressure is high enouhg the led on the outside of the dressing room wil change from green to red to indicate that it's in use. //
// At the same time a console at the checkout turns on to notify the staff that someone entered a dressing room. We now need to make it so //
// staff can manually reset the led indicator to show it has been checked. so only the red leds on the console //
// need to be reset to green and the led at the actual dressing room needs to stay red. //
